## Course Description

The course on Human Genome Variation has exposed you to the power of genomic studies for understanding human evolutionary history as well as revealing the genetic basis of human traits and disease.

What does real human genomic data look like? How are these data analyzed in practice? Supplementing the main course, this lab module will explore public datasets and computational tools used to analyze human genomic data to better understand how patterns in these data can be used to test hypotheses about evolution and human phenotypes.

#### Educational Objectives

* Explore the ways in which human genomic data is generated, encoded, summarized, and visualized.
*	Develop an awareness of potential confounding factors and approaches by which they can be overcome.
* Establish familiarity working with summarized forms of genomic data in R, as well as resources for further independent learning.


## Assessment & Grading

All students will conduct mid-term and final self-evaluations and use these evaluations for self-grading. The instructor will provide individual feedback on these evaluations.

Final grades will be determined either through:

1. A comprehensive final exam that is graded by the instructors
2. A self-grade that is based upon criteria set forth in your self-evaluations.

To qualify for self-grading, students must demonstrate participation in 12 out of 13 class sessions. Participation can be demonstrated by in-person class attendance or, if absent from class, via evidence of work on the Posit Cloud workspace associated with a particular week.

#### Homework

There are required and optional homework assignments for each topic we cover.


## Posit Cloud

All the coding and lectures for this class are conducted on Posit Cloud.

Posit is a computing environment for **R**, one of the most widely used coding languages in genomics and statistics.

**Posit Cloud** is an online version of the Posit environment. This cloud workspace avoids us having to install R on everyone's computers, and also allows us to upload and share data files for class.
