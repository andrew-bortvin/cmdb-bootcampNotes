## Pandas

Along with `numpy`, `pandas` is one of the most common Python libraries for working with tabular data. Where `numpy` is optimized for working for matrices of numerical data and rapid mathematical operations, `pandas` is designed for **manipulating and reshaping tables that contain multiple data types**. As with other packages, it is conventional to import pandas with a shortened name, as:

```{r, engine='python', eval=FALSE}
pd.read_csv()
```

The most important data type that we use in `pandas` is the DataFrame, which is a two-dimensional data structure. A typical DataFrame looks like this: 

<img src="img/iris.png" title="Iris dataset" alt="Iris dataset." style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Note the overall organization of this DataFrame: 

* In the leftmost column, we have the **indices**, which are the row names of our DataFrame. Here, the indices are the integer row numbers.
* In the top row, we have the **column names** of our dataframe.  

Also note that the `Species` column consists of strings, while the other columns consist of numeric values. Datasets that mix data types like this are where `pandas` is best used. 

### Importing Data 

The key function we will use to import data is `pd.read_csv()`. The only required argument to this function is the name of the file you are trying to import, and by default `pandas` will do a lot ot infer the appropriate settings to correctly read in your data. However, it doesn't always get things right, especially for more complicated datasets. Some useful arguments that can control how your file is imported are:

* `sep` - a string which separates values. By default, `,`.
* `header` - the row number in your data that contains the header. The header is used to infer column names.
* `names` - this argument allows you to explicitly provide the names of your columns 
* `index_col` - the column which provides the index 
* `usecols` - if you only want to read in a subset of your data, this argument lets you specify which columns to use

The `iris` dataset pictured above is nicely formatted for import with `pandas`; it can be read in with a simple comand of:

```{r, engine='python', eval=FALSE}
iris = pd.read_csv('iris.csv')
```

### Subsetting Data

To subset `pandas` DataFrames, we use the syntax: `<DataFrameName>.loc[<rows>, <columns>]`

For example, if we want to find the petal width of the plant in the fifth row, we use the following notation:

```{r, engine='python', eval = FALSE}
iris.loc[4, 'Petal.Width']
```

<img src="img/subset1" title="Iris dataset, subsetted" alt="Iris dataset, subsetted" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

As with lists, we can use a colon to indicate a range of values that we want to subset:

```{r, engine='python', eval = FALSE}
iris.loc[18:22, 'Sepal.Width']
```

<img src="img/subset2" title="Iris dataset, subsetted" alt="Iris dataset, subsetted" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Also as with lists, leaving one side of the colon blank indicates that we want to index to the start/end of the data structure. Therefore, the following notation extracts an entire column: 

```{r, engine='python', eval = FALSE}
iris.loc[:, 'Species']
```

<img src="img/subset3" title="Iris dataset, subsetted" alt="Iris dataset, subsetted" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
