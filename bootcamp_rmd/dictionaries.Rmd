## Dictionaries

A dictionary is a way of storing data, associating each item in the dictionary with a name. The common example used to conceptualize this is a phone book - each name is associated with a phone number. 

We can define a dictionary using the following syntax:

```{r, engine='python', eval=FALSE}
dictionaryName = {<key1> : <value1>, 
                  <key2> : <value2>}
```

The `keys` in a dictionary are conventionally a string or an integer. The `values` can be most data types (lists, integers, floats, etc.).

A simple creation of a dictionary: 

```{r, engine='python'}
codons = {'Phe' : ['UUG'], 
          'Leu' : ['CUU']}
          
print(codons)
```
