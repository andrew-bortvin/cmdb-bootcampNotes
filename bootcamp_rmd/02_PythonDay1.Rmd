### Types of Data

**Integers** Integers are whole numbers, without a decimal point. For example:

* 2
* -3 
* 0

**Floats** Floats are numbers with a decimal point. For example: 

* 1.2
* -3.0
* 26/3 (This one doesn't actually have a decimal point written in by me, but is a float because the expression evaluates to 8.666)

**Strings** Strings are character data enclosed by single ' or double " quotation marks. Any text enclosed by quotes will be treated as a string.

* "My Grandpa's deck has no pathetic cards"
* '85.3'

Note the second example â€“ `85.3` is a float; `"85.3"` is a string.

**Booleans** A Boolean has two possible values: `True` and `False`. These can be expressed interchangeably as `1` or `0`, respectively.
