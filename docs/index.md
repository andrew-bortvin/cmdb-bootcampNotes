# Homepage

This is the course homepage for Human Genome Variation with Computational Lab (`AS.020.321`).

#### Class Info

Class is held on **Tuesdays from 3-3:50PM**, in **(location TBD)**.

Please bring your laptop with you to every class. If you donâ€™t have a working laptop, contact me so that we can find a solution.

## Syllabus & Logistics

Download a copy of the syllabus [here]().

### Assessment & Grading

Final grades will be determined through either:

1. A comprehensive final exam that is graded by the instructors, or
2. A self-grade based upon criteria set forth in your self-evaluations.

To qualify for self-grading, students must demonstrate participation in 12 out of 13 class sessions. 

### Homework

There are required and optional homework assignments for each topic we cover.

## Course Description

The Human Genome Variation course exposes you to the power of genomic studies for understanding human evolutionary history, as well as revealing the genetic basis of human traits and disease.

What does real human genomic data look like? How are these data analyzed in practice? Supplementing the main course, this lab module will explore public datasets and computational tools used to analyze human genomic data to better understand how patterns in these data can be used to test hypotheses about evolution and human phenotypes.

### Educational Objectives

* Explore the ways in which human genomic data is generated, encoded, summarized, and visualized.
*	Develop an awareness of potential confounding factors and approaches by which they can be overcome.
* Establish familiarity working with summarized forms of genomic data in R, as well as resources for further independent learning.

<!-- * human genetics/genomics has led the way for improving on transparency and reproducibility in science -->
<!-- * standards in the community where when you publish a reserach study, the raw data and code have to be made publicly available -->
<!-- * the public and other scientists benefit from this; now we can also benefit from it as students -->

## RStudio Cloud

All the coding and lectures for this class are conducted on RStudio Cloud.

RStudio is a computing environment for **R**, one of the most widely used coding languages in genomics and statistics.

**RStudio Cloud** is an online version of the RStudio environment. This cloud workspace avoids us having to install R on everyone's computers, and also allows us to upload and share data files for class.

### Making an RStudio Cloud account

Go to the [RStudio Cloud website](https://login.rstudio.cloud/register) and sign up for an account, using your JHU email.

Then, join the [HGV Lab workspace]().
