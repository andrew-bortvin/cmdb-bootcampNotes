Interpret the results of a linear model. Compare the impact of maternal vs. paternal age on de novo mutation counts. Explain what a confidence interval is and why it’s useful. "],["de-novo-mutations.html", "2.1 De novo mutations", " 2.1 De novo mutations Mutation and recombination are two biological processes that generate genetic variation. When these phenomena occur during gametogenesis, the changes that they make to DNA are passed down to the next generation through germline cells (i.e., sperm and oocyte). De novo mutations (DNMs) arise from errors in DNA replication or repair. These mutations can be single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or insertions and deletions of DNA. Every individual typically carries around 70 de novo SNPs that were not present in either of their parents. "],["recombination.html", "2.2 Recombination", " 2.2 Recombination Crossovers, or meiotic recombination, occur during prophase of meiosis I, when homologous chromosomes pair with each other. Double-strand breaks are deliberately generated in the DNA, and are then cut back and repaired based on the sequence of the homologous chromosome. These repairs can sometimes resolve in a crossover event, where sections of DNA are swapped between chromosomes. Because the sequences of homologous chromosomes differ at sites where they carry different alleles, recombination generates genetic diversity by creating new haplotypes, or combinations of alleles. Crossovers are required for meiosis in most organisms because they ensure proper homologous chromosome pairing and segregation. Humans experience 1-4 crossover events per chromosome, with longer chromosomes having more crossovers.
