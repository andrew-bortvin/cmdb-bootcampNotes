For example: 2 -3 0 Floats Floats are numbers with a decimal point. For example: 1.2 -3.0 26/3 (This one doesn’t actually have a decimal point written in by me, but is a float because the expression evaluates to 8.666) Strings Strings are character data enclosed by single ’ or double ” quotation marks. Any text enclosed by quotes will be treated as a string. “My Grandpa’s deck has no pathetic cards” ‘85.3’ Note the second example – 85.3 is a float; \"85.3\" is a string. Booleans A Boolean has two possible values: True and False. These can be expressed interchangeably as 1 or 0, respectively. 3.1.2 Variables A variable is assigned using the equals sign, with this general syntax: variable_name = value. For example: composer = \"buxtehude\" year = 1637 The data name can be almost anything. Here are the rules to consider when naming a variable: A variable name must start with a letter or underscore A variable name can only consist of letters, numbers, or underscores Variables are case sensitive (i.e. Python would interpret my_number, MY_NUMBER, and My_Number as different variables) Python has a set of “reserved words” that cannot be used as variable names. These are words that already have a set meaning in Python, such as ‘True’, ‘False’, ‘for’, and ‘if’. A full list can be found here: https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/keywords-identifier 3.1.3 Mathematical Operations A lot of mathematical operations in Python are straightforward. Here are some of the basic operations we can perform + and - – addition and subtraction * and / – multiplication and division ** – Exponentials We can perform mathematical operations on values directly: print(2 + 3) ## 5 or we can operate on variables: myValue = 4 print(myValue**2) ## 16 Mathematical conversions will automatically convert integers to floats when appropriate: print(3 + 2.2) ## 5.2 We can save the output of an expression as a variable: my_product = 2 * 10 print(my_product) ## 20 And likewise we can perform mathematical operations on variables, provided these variables store numeric data: number1 = 7 print(number1 / 2) ## 3.5 3.1.4 Order of operations Python follows the usual mathematical order of operations. And like usual in math, we can use parenthesis () to enforce a specific order. print(6 - 7 * 2 + (8-4) * 4) ## 8 3.1.5 Comparisons In Python, comparisons will always return a Boolean, i.e. either True or False. We can use the following syntax to compare values: &lt; and &gt; to compare greater than/less than &lt;= and &gt;= for greater than or equal to/less than or equal to For example: print(5.3 &lt; 17) ## True print(4. &gt;= (8/2)) ## True == checks if two values are equal. != checks that two values are different. print((2**3) != (17 - 9)) ## False Note that a single equals sign = is used to assign values. So var1 = 3 is setting var1 equal to 3. However, a double equals sign == is used to compare values. var1 == 3 is checking if the value of var1 is 3. "],["built-in-functions-and-methods.html", "3.2 Built-In Functions and Methods", " 3.2 Built-In Functions and Methods 3.2.1 Functions A function is a block of code that performs a task. Python comes with a substantial set of pre-written functions. Text on how a function is formulated - name, parentheses, optionally arguments Is it worth talking about named arguments or positional arguments. Be introspective about this For example, the print() function displays FINISH ME OTHER Built-In FUNCTIONS’ 3.2.2 Methods Every data type that we use in Python (that is, strings, integers, etc.) is associated with a set of functions unique to the data type. These functions are called methods. The syntax for using a method is as follows: &lt;objectName&gt;.&lt;methodName&gt;(). For example, the method .upper() belongs to strings and is used to convert a string into capital letters. We can use it with any string either directly on the string itself: &quot;Quod est superius est sicut quod inferius&quot;.upper() ## &#39;QUOD EST SUPERIUS EST SICUT QUOD INFERIUS&#39; or by operating on a variable: pig = &quot;peppa&quot; pig.upper() ## &#39;PEPPA&#39; Using a method may or not modify the underlying object. For example, the .upper() method shows you the uppercase version of a string but does not modify the actual variable that you are operating on. Observe the following code block: pig = &quot;peppa&quot; pig.upper() We’ve returned the uppercase version of the pig variable, but has this value been saved? No: print(pig) ## peppa To actually save the result of this method, we have to use variable assignment, for example like so: pig = &quot;peppa&quot; pig = pig.upper() print(pig) ## PEPPA Some methods do in fact modify underlying variables. For example, the list .append() method which we will learn about later does change the list if operates on, so in the following code block: myList = [] myList.append(&#39;apple&#39;) myList is changed by myList.append('apple'). There’s no need to type something like myList = myList.append('apple') - this would in fact be an error. Which methods modify the objects they operate on is something you’ll have to keep track of on a case-by-case basis as you learn new methods. "],["type-conversion.html", "3.3 Type Conversion", " 3.3 Type Conversion "],["string-methods.html", "3.4 String Methods", " 3.4 String Methods 3.4.1 .upper() and .lower() 3.4.2 .split() 3.4.3 .join() 3.4.4 .strip() "],["lists.html", "3.5 Lists", " 3.5 Lists Each variable has stored a single piece of information, e.g. a single integer or a discrete string. Lists allow us to store multiple items together? A list is a sequential group of variables, denoted in Python by square brackets [], with individual entries separated by commas. A few of the neat properties of lists are: Lists have a preserved order. The list [1, 5, 3, 7] will always store those numbers in the same order. Lists can mix data types. [\"mercury\", 13, 5.3, False] is a valid list which contains every data type we’ve seen so far. Lists can also contain other lists: [\"sulfur\", 12, [3, 2], 18] Lists can have identical values repeatedly. This is valid list design: [“tomato”, “tomato”, “tomato”, 3, “tomato”] 3.5.1 Indexing What if we want to extract a specific value from a list? We can use indexing. To index in Python, we use the following syntax: variable_name[index], with index being an integer referring to the position we wish to extract. alchemists = [&quot;Zosimos&quot;, &quot;Oresme&quot;, &quot;Flamel&quot;, &quot;pseudo-Aristotle&quot;] print(alchemists[1]) ## Oresme Notice that when we printed the item at position 1, we printed out the second entry in my_list. This is because in Python, indexes start at 0. So to print out the first entry, we would use alchemists[0]. A couple interesting things we can do with indexing: To print multiple consecutive number, we can provie two numbers separated by a colon :. Note that the first number is inclusive and the second number is exclusive. For example, in the sample below, we provide the index 1:3. This prints out the item at position 1 (‘Oresme’), the item at position 2 (‘Flamel’) and not the item at position 3 (‘pseudo-Aristotle’). print(alchemists[1:3]) ## [&#39;Oresme&#39;, &#39;Flamel&#39;] We can index in reverse. To index from the end of the list, we use negative numbers. print(alchemists[-1]) print(alchemists[-2]) print(alchemists[-3]) ## pseudo-Aristotle ## Flamel ## Oresme What if we have a list within a list? Consider the following list: my_list = [1, 2, [3, 4], 5] How would we point to the number 3 in this list? First, we can point to the interior list. The interior list is the third item in the list, so it is at position 2 (remember, indexing in Python starts at 0). So we can access the interior list with my_list[2]. Within the interior list, 3 is the first item, so it is at position 0. It can be accessed with the syntax my_list[2][0] my_list = [1, 2, [3, 4], 5] print(my_list[2]) print(my_list[2][0]) ## [3, 4] ## 3 3.5.2 Adding to lists - Append One last interesting thing we can do with lists is we can add entries to the end of a list. We do this using the append() method, which is used with the following syntax: list_name.append(item) For an example: florilegium = [&#39;marigold&#39;, &#39;thistle&#39;, &#39;wormwood&#39;] florilegium.append(&#39;tansy&#39;) print(florilegium) ## [&#39;marigold&#39;, &#39;thistle&#39;, &#39;wormwood&#39;, &#39;tansy&#39;] "],["for-loops.html", "3.6 For Loops", " 3.6 For Loops "],["modules.html", "3.7 Modules", " 3.7 Modules Often, we need to make use of functions beyond those that are packaged with Python. To do this, we can import a module, or a collection of pre-written functions. A module is imported with the following syntax: import &lt;module name&gt;. For example, to import the popular plotting module Matplotlib, we write: import matplotlib.pyplot To use a function from this module, we need to reference both the package name and the function name, with the general syntax: moduleName.functionName(). To user Matplotlib’s show() function, we would write: matplotlib.pyplot.show() What if you don’t want to write out matplotlib.pyplot in full each time that you run a Matplotlib function? To simplify this, we can give our modules a shorthand name. For example: import matplotlib.pyplot as plt Now, instead of writing out matplotlib.pyplot, we can just write plt. The previous matplotlib.pyplot.show() command is shortened to: plt.show() "],["plotting.html", "3.8 Plotting", " 3.8 Plotting In this course, we will use the library Matplotlib for plotting. For concision, we will import the matplotlib.pyplot module with the name plt, as such: import matplotlib.pyplot as plt "],["errors.html", "3.9 Errors", " 3.9 Errors "],["git.html", "4 Git ", " 4 Git "],["tracking-changes.html", "4.1 Tracking Changes", " 4.1 Tracking Changes "],["ignoring-things.html", "4.2 Ignoring Things", " 4.2 Ignoring Things "],["authors.html", "Authors", " Authors     Credits Names Pedagogy Instructor Rajiv McCoy Content Author Stephanie Yan Content Author Kate Weaver Website Template Jeff Leek &amp; The Johns Hopkins Data Science Lab Design Inspiration Ali Madooei &amp; JHU Data Structures Funding JHU Center for Educational Resources Techology Fellowship Grant   ## ─ Session info ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── ## setting value ## version R version 4.0.2 (2020-06-22) ## os Ubuntu 20.04.5 LTS ## system x86_64, linux-gnu ## ui X11 ## language (EN) ## collate en_US.UTF-8 ## ctype en_US.UTF-8 ## tz Etc/UTC ## date 2023-08-09 ## ## ─ Packages ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── ## package * version date lib source ## assertthat 0.2.1 2019-03-21 [1] RSPM (R 4.0.5) ## bookdown 0.24 2023-03-28 [1] Github (rstudio/bookdown@88bc4ea) ## bslib 0.4.2 2022-12-16 [1] CRAN (R 4.0.2) ## cachem 1.0.7 2023-02-24 [1] CRAN (R 4.0.2) ## callr 3.5.0 2020-10-08 [1] RSPM (R 4.0.2) ## cli 3.6.1 2023-03-23 [1] CRAN (R 4.0.2) ## crayon 1.3.4 2017-09-16 [1] RSPM (R 4.0.0) ## desc 1.2.0 2018-05-01 [1] RSPM (R 4.0.3) ## devtools 2.3.2 2020-09-18 [1] RSPM (R 4.0.3) ## digest 0.6.25 2020-02-23 [1] RSPM (R 4.0.0) ## ellipsis 0.3.1 2020-05-15 [1] RSPM (R 4.0.3) ## evaluate 0.20 2023-01-17 [1] CRAN (R 4.0.2) ## fansi 0.4.1 2020-01-08 [1] RSPM (R 4.0.0) ## fastmap 1.1.1 2023-02-24 [1] CRAN (R 4.0.2) ## fs 1.5.0 2020-07-31 [1] RSPM (R 4.0.3) ## glue 1.4.2 2020-08-27 [1] RSPM (R 4.0.5) ## here 1.0.1 2020-12-13 [1] CRAN (R 4.0.2) ## hms 0.5.3 2020-01-08 [1] RSPM (R 4.0.0) ## htmltools 0.5.5 2023-03-23 [1] CRAN (R 4.0.2) ## jquerylib 0.1.4 2021-04-26 [1] CRAN (R 4.0.2) ## jsonlite 1.7.1 2020-09-07 [1] RSPM (R 4.0.2) ## knitr 1.33 2023-03-28 [1] Github (yihui/knitr@a1052d1) ## lattice 0.20-41 2020-04-02 [2] CRAN (R 4.0.2) ## lifecycle 1.0.3 2022-10-07 [1] CRAN (R 4.0.2) ## magrittr 2.0.3 2022-03-30 [1] CRAN (R 4.0.2) ## Matrix 1.2-18 2019-11-27 [2] CRAN (R 4.0.2) ## memoise 2.0.1 2021-11-26 [1] CRAN (R 4.0.2) ## ottrpal 1.0.1 2023-03-28 [1] Github (jhudsl/ottrpal@151e412) ## pillar 1.9.0 2023-03-22 [1] CRAN (R 4.0.2) ## pkgbuild 1.1.0 2020-07-13 [1] RSPM (R 4.0.2) ## pkgconfig 2.0.3 2019-09-22 [1] RSPM (R 4.0.3) ## pkgload 1.1.0 2020-05-29 [1] RSPM (R 4.0.3) ## png 0.1-8 2022-11-29 [1] CRAN (R 4.0.2) ## prettyunits 1.1.1 2020-01-24 [1] RSPM (R 4.0.3) ## processx 3.4.4 2020-09-03 [1] RSPM (R 4.0.2) ## ps 1.4.0 2020-10-07 [1] RSPM (R 4.0.2) ## R6 2.4.1 2019-11-12 [1] RSPM (R 4.0.0) ## rappdirs 0.3.3 2021-01-31 [1] CRAN (R 4.0.2) ## Rcpp 1.0.10 2023-01-22 [1] CRAN (R 4.0.2) ## readr 1.4.0 2020-10-05 [1] RSPM (R 4.0.2) ## remotes 2.2.0 2020-07-21 [1] RSPM (R 4.0.3) ## reticulate 1.28 2023-01-27 [1] CRAN (R 4.0.2) ## rlang 1.1.0 2023-03-14 [1] CRAN (R 4.0.2) ## rmarkdown 2.10 2023-03-28 [1] Github (rstudio/rmarkdown@02d3c25) ## rprojroot 2.0.3 2022-04-02 [1] CRAN (R 4.0.2) ## rstudioapi 0.11 2020-02-07 [1] RSPM (R 4.0.0) ## sass 0.4.5 2023-01-24 [1] CRAN (R 4.0.2) ## sessioninfo 1.1.1 2018-11-05 [1] RSPM (R 4.0.3) ## stringi 1.5.3 2020-09-09 [1] RSPM (R 4.0.3) ## stringr 1.4.0 2019-02-10 [1] RSPM (R 4.0.3) ## testthat 3.0.1 2023-03-28 [1] Github (R-lib/testthat@e99155a) ## tibble 3.2.1 2023-03-20 [1] CRAN (R 4.0.2) ## usethis 1.6.3 2020-09-17 [1] RSPM (R 4.0.2) ## utf8 1.1.4 2018-05-24 [1] RSPM (R 4.0.3) ## vctrs 0.6.1 2023-03-22 [1] CRAN (R 4.0.2) ## withr 2.3.0 2020-09-22 [1] RSPM (R 4.0.2) ## xfun 0.26 2023-03-28 [1] Github (yihui/xfun@74c2a66) ## yaml 2.2.1 2020-02-01 [1] RSPM (R 4.0.3) ## ## [1] /usr/local/lib/R/site-library ## [2] /usr/local/lib/R/library "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
