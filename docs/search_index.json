What does real human genomic data look like? How are these data analyzed in practice? Supplementing the main course, this lab module will explore public datasets and computational tools used to analyze human genomic data to better understand how patterns in these data can be used to test hypotheses about evolution and human phenotypes. 1.1.0.1 Educational Objectives Explore the ways in which human genomic data is generated, encoded, summarized, and visualized. Develop an awareness of potential confounding factors and approaches by which they can be overcome. Establish familiarity working with summarized forms of genomic data in R, as well as resources for further independent learning.

The broad steps of this sequencing process are: Extract DNA Fragment DNA Prepare for sequencer (add adapters, etc.) Amplify DNA Sequencing (add fluorescently labeled nucleotides that are read by a digital camera) Fig. 1 (source). Schematic of Illumina short-read sequencing. This sequencing approach is fast and cost efficient, but introduces two main limitations. Because of the fragmentation step, the resulting sequencing reads are extremely short (~150 bp). We don’t know where in the genome the sequencing reads came from. (This is a limitation common to nearly every sequencing experiment.) "],["assembling-a-genome.html", "2.2 Assembling a genome", " 2.2 Assembling a genome When the human genome is 3 billion base pairs long, assembling short sequencing reads into a full genome is a major computational challenge. How is genome assembly performed? We can combine sequencing reads that partially overlap with each other into longer sequences. Fig. 2. Using overlapping sequencing reads to assemble a genome. Which regions of the genome are hardest to assemble? Ideally, with enough sequencing data, we would be able to reconstruct an entire genome from overlapping reads. In practice, genome assembly is complicated by repetitive DNA – sequences in different regions of the genome that are completely or nearly identical. These repeats make it difficult (or impossible) to determine the order of the sequences around them, or how many copies of the repeat there are. Fig. 3. How repetitive sequences affect genome assembly. Resolving repetitive regions requires sequencing reads that are longer than the repeat itself, which allow us to determine the flanking sequences on the sides of the repeat. Using such long-read sequencing technology (i.e., PacBio and Nanopore sequencing), the Telomere-to-Telomere consortium was able to create a complete, ungapped assembly of the human genome in 2021. "],["the-human-reference-genome.html", "2.3 The human reference genome", " 2.3 The human reference genome Having to assemble an entire genome every time you sequence a new individual is a hassle (and often infeasible, if you don’t have enough sequencing data). Instead, we typically align sequencing reads to a reference genome – a high-quality genome assembly for that species, which we use to guide our analysis. The human reference genome was initially assembled in 2000 by the Human Genome Project, and has undergone decades of refinement since. The current version of this reference, which we’ll be using, is hg38. Whose DNA was sequenced for the human reference genome? DNA from multiple individuals was sequenced to construct the reference genome. Its sequence is a mosaic of these individuals’ DNA. You can classify the ancestry of different parts of hg38 by comparing its sequence to DNA from different populations. From this, we know that around 70% of hg38 comes from one individual, called RP11, who likely had African American ancestry. Fig. 4. Sample composition of the human reference genome.

These differences can be caused by either real genetic variation or sequencing error. How would you distinguish these two? Fig. 20. Two of these colored bases are probably real SNPs, and two are probably errors. The sequencing coverage track also colors the positions that it thinks are real variants. In the screenshot above, which spans about 2kb, there are two SNPsin the coverage track. This pattern holds more broadly through the genome – humans carry about one SNP every 1,000 bases. Is one SNP every 1,000bp a lot or a little? Humans actually have much lower amounts of genetic variation than many species, including many of the great apes. This is mostly the result of human evolutionary history. Because the effective size of human populations has historically been low, with only very recent expansion, the gene pool is still fairly homogenous, with many rare variants and few common ones.

When these phenomena occur during gametogenesis, the changes that they make to DNA are passed down to the next generation through germline cells (i.e., sperm and oocyte). De novo mutations (DNMs) arise from errors in DNA replication or repair. These mutations can be single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or insertions and deletions of DNA. Every individual typically carries around 70 de novo SNPs that were not present in either of their parents. Fig. 1. Sources of DNMs in gametogenesis. "],["recombination.html", "3.2 Recombination", " 3.2 Recombination Crossovers, or meiotic recombination, occur during prophase of meiosis I, when homologous chromosomes pair with each other. Double-strand breaks are deliberately generated in the DNA, and are then cut back and repaired based on the sequence of the homologous chromosome. These repairs can sometimes resolve in a crossover event, where sections of DNA are swapped between chromosomes. Because the sequences of homologous chromosomes differ at sites where they carry different alleles, recombination generates genetic diversity by creating new haplotypes, or combinations of alleles. Crossovers are required for meiosis in most organisms because they ensure proper homologous chromosome pairing and segregation. Humans experience 1-4 crossover events per chromosome, with longer chromosomes having more crossovers. Fig. 2. Possible outcomes for double-strand breaks generated during meiosis I.

(For example, what if there’s a lot of variability in the maternal DNM data, and the true maternal coefficient could be anywhere between -1 and 10?) To do this, we compare the confidence intervals of our slope estimates. What is a confidence interval? We use confidence intervals when estimating a value – in this case, the Mother_age and Father_age slope parameters. A confidence interval (CI) is a random interval that has a 95% probability of falling on the parameter we are estimating. So, a 95% CI contains the true value of the slope 95% of the time. Keep in mind that the definition above (95% of random intervals fall on the true value) is not the same as saying there is a 95% chance that the true value falls within our interval. This latter statement is not accurate. In R, we get the confidence interval of a parameter from a linear model with the confint function. ?confint confint requires three arguments: A fitted linear model (our fit_pat variable) The parameter we want a CI for (Father_age) The CI’s probability (typically 95%) "],["calculate-95-cis.html", "3.8 Calculate 95% CIs", " 3.8 Calculate 95% CIs Run the following code to calculate the 95% confidence interval for the Father_age slope parameter. confint(fit_pat, &#39;Father_age&#39;, level = 0.95) ## 2.5 % 97.5 % ## Father_age 1.243118 1.45386 So, 95% of the time, the number of additional DNMs per year of paternal age is between 1.24 and 1.45.

Now that we have the confidence intervals for both slope parameters, we can finally compare them. Our two CI ranges are non-overlapping. The paternal range is [1.24, 1.45] and the maternal range is [0.31, 0.45]. If the 95% CIs for two parameters don’t overlap, this strongly supports that the parameters are significantly different from one another. So, it seems likely that paternal and maternal gametes experience different rates of de novo mutation. If the CIs for two parameters overlap, are they not significantly different? Not necessarily. More analysis, like a hypothesis test, is needed to make a final decision.

We plotted the relationship between maternal/paternal age and DNM count. This visualization suggested that DNM count increases with age for both groups. We confirmed this hypothesis by using a linear model, which tests if additional years of age have a non-zero effect on the number of DNMs. The number of paternal DNMs seemed to increase more quickly with age than maternal DNMs. We confirmed this by comparing the 95% confidence intervals of the slopes of the two models.

Linkage disequlibrium (LD) refers to correlation among genotypes at multiple sites in the genome. This is a consequence of the fact that chromosomes are transmitted in “chunks” through the generations. When mutations arise, they arise on a single chromosome with a given set of alleles. The new mutation will continue to be associated with this genetic background until it is shuffled during the process of meiotic recombination. Together, a set of alleles that tend to occur together because of linkage disequilibrium is called a haplotype. Fig. 1. After a new mutation arises, recombination over the course of many generations reduces the number of variants in LD with it. "],["why-do-we-care-about-ld.html", "4.2 Why do we care about LD?", " 4.2 Why do we care about LD? As a result of linkage disequilibrium, knowledge of a genotype at one site in the genome can provide information about the genotype at another site, even if the second site was not actually genotyped. Using prior knowledge of LD to “fill in” missing genotype information is a process called imputation. Linkage disequilibrium also means that correlation between a genotype at a particular site and phenotype (e.g., disease outcome) does not imply causation. Even ignoring other possible confounders, any variant on the same haplotype could be driving the association. Beyond mutation and recombination, other evolutionary forces such as gene flow, genetic drift, and natural selection can also influence patterns of LD observed in population genetic data. Measuring linkage disequilibrium is therefore important for both medical and evolutionary studies. Fig. 2. LD can be used to impute missing genotypes, but also complicates genetic association studies (such as finding variants that cause disease). Non-causal variants in LD will perfectly co-occur with the causal variant, making it difficult to determine which one is truly causal.

In this context, the odds ratio reflects how much more likely you are to see an A at SNP1 if you also see an C at SNP2. We can observe that the 95% confidence interval doesn’t overlap with 1. An odds ratio of 1 would mean that seeing C at SNP2 doesn’t influence the probability of seeing an A at SNP1. This is a somewhat non-canonical usage of Fisher’s exact test, and in our case the odds ratio applies to whatever haplotype is in the top left corner of our 4x4 table. We could rearrange the table to calculate the odds ratio for any of the three other combinations of alleles.

Individuals within a population tend to be share greater genetic similarity with each other than with individuals in other populations. These differences manifest through differences in allele frequencies among populations, and result from genetic drift, natural selection, and other evolutionary forces. We can measure such allele frequency differences to reveal evolutionary relationships among populations, as well as evidence of historical natural selection. Fig. 1. Two populations polymorphic for alleles A and a. The frequency of A in Population 1 is \\(0.83\\), while its frequency in Population 2 is \\(0.15\\). "],["geography-of-genetic-variants.html", "5.2 Geography of Genetic Variants", " 5.2 Geography of Genetic Variants One quick way to visualize population structure in humans is to look at the allele frequencies of genetic variants in different regions of the world. The Geography of Genetic Variants (GGV) browser is a website that plots allele frequencies from the 1000 Genomes dataset. For a given variant, GGV plots piecharts of its frequency in the 26 populations in 1000 Genomes, superimposed over the population’s geographical location. While some variants have very similar frequencies across populations, others are much more common in specific populations – usually suggesting that these populations are more closely related to each other.

"],["variant-call-format-vcf.html", "5.3 Variant Call Format (VCF)", " 5.3 Variant Call Format (VCF) We’re investigating population structure in genotype data from the 1000 Genomes Project. We’ll eventually work with an R-specific form of this data, but first let’s look at the full file, which is in Variant Call Format (VCF). 5.3.1 What is a VCF? VCF files store genotype data at variable sites. Every line of a VCF represents a genetic variant, and contains information about what the variant is and which individuals carry it. While these are just text files, they have a strange format that goes beyond a simple table. This is a preview of the first few lines of random_snippet.vcf.gz, which we’ll be working with today: Fig. 3. A preview of random_snippet.vcf.gz. How do you read a VCF file? The first section of a VCF is a multi-line header – marked by the # character – which contains metadata and descriptions of the FILTER, INFO, and FORMAT columns. (For example, the INFO column usually includes information like the variant’s allele frequency, and each field is described in the header.) The final line of the header gives the names of the columns. The data section of a VCF describes its variants and genotypes. The first 8 columns are about the variant itself – its position, the reference/alternative alleles, etc. The rest of the VCF columns contain the genotypes of all the samples it has data for. Here, every column is one individual from the 1000 Genomes Project (so there are 2,504 columns total). How do you interpret VCF genotypes? 0|0: homozygous reference (does not carry the variant) 0|1 or 1|0: heterozygous 1|1: homozygous alternate (both chromosomes have the variant) .: Missing genotype (could not be confidently called) The sample-specific columns often include additional genotype information, like the number of sequencing reads from the individual that support the reference vs. alternative alleles. The included fields are specified in the FORMAT column (which in this case just reads GT, for “genotype”).

These allele frequencies were calculated in the original VCF, and are now in the AF column of variants. Plot the AFS using the data from variants ggplot(data = variants, aes(x = AF)) + geom_histogram(bins = 100) Interpreting the AFS The allele frequencies in this dataset range from 0 to 1, with an exponential decay from zero, indicating that the majority of variants are rare. This is the expected shape of an AFS, since all variants arise in one individual and are unlikely to spread widely through the population just by chance. This distribution is exacerbated in human populations, where recent population expansions have resulted in an excess of rare variation.

Rare variants are more likely to show fine-grained population structure – for example, a variant may be carried by just one individual, or just one family. Because there are so many rare variants, including them causes differences between individuals to be more pronounced than differences between populations. While this is a biologically true statement, it makes it harder to visualize population structure, which is why we subset to common variation for PCA.

We quantify this by calculating the proportion of variance explained for each PC. This tells us how much of the variation in our data is being captured by PC1, PC2, etc. Variance is the square of the standard deviation, so we can calculate proportion of variance explained from the sdev item in our pca object.

We explored the Geography of Genetic Variants browser, a useful resource for visualizing allele frequency differences between human populations. We introduced VCF format, a common file format for storing genotype data. Using the vcfR package, we read in the VCF and subset to common variants. We plotted the allele frequency spectrum of variants. By calculating \\(\\mathbf{F_{ST}}\\), we found that most variants show very little frequency differentiation across populations.
